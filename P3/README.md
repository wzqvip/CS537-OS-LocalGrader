This README describes how to run the tests for P3. 

List of Testing Scripts:
~cs537-1/tests/P3/test-cd.csh
~cs537-1/tests/P3/test-exec.csh
~cs537-1/tests/P3/test-history.csh
~cs537-1/tests/P3/test-pipe.csh
~cs537-1/tests/P3/tests-variables.csh


For example, to test your implementation of cd command, just type:

prompt> ~cs537-1/tests/P3/test-cd.csh

To see what commands are executed on your wsh in the tests, pass '-v' flag to the script. You would type: 

prompt> $ ~cs537-1/tests/P3/test-cd.csh -v
