Hailstones and Halibut Bones
By Mary O' Neill

What is Purple? 

Time is purple
Just before night
When most people
Turn on the light
But if you don't it's
A beautiful sight.
Asters are purple,
There's purple ink.
Purple's more popular
Than you think....
It's sort of a great
Grandmother to pink.
There are purple shadows
And purple veils,
Some ladies purple
Their fingernails.
There's purple jam
And purple jell
And a bruise
Next day will tell
Where you landed
When you fell.
The purple feeling
Is rather put-out
The purple look is a
Definite pout.
But the purple sound
Is the loveliest thing
It's a violet opening
In the spring.

What is Gold?

Gold is a Metal
Gold is a ring
Gold is a very
Beautiful thing.
Gold is the sunshine
Light and thin
Warm as a muffin
On your skin.
Gold is the moon
Gold are the stars;
Jupiter, Venus
Saturn and Mars.

What is Orange?

Orange is a tiger lily,
A carrot, 
A feather from 
A parrot, 
A flame, 
The wildest color you can name. 
Saying good-bye 
In a sunset that 
Shocks the sky . 
Orange is brave 
Orange is bold 
It's bittersweet 
And marigold. 
Orange is zip 
Orange is dash 
The brightest stripe 
In a Roman sash. 
Orange is an orange 
Also a mango. 
Orange is the music 
Of the tango. 
Orange is the fur 
Of the fiery fox, 
The brightest crayon 
In the box.
And in the fall 
When the leaves are tuming 
Orange is the smell 
Of a bonfire burning.

What is Yellow?

Yellow is the color of the sun,
The feeling of fun,
The yolk of an egg,
A duck's bill,
A canary bird,
And a daffodil.

WHAT IS RED?
 
Red is a sunset
Blazy and bright.
Read is a feeling brave
With all your might
Red is a sunburn
Spot on your nose, sometimes red
Is a red, red, rose.
Red squiggles out
When you cut your hand.
Red is a brick and a rubber band.
Read is a hotness
You get inside
When you're embarrassed
And want to hide.
Firecracker, fire engine
Fire flicker red
And when you're angry
Red runs through your head.
Read is an Indian,
A Valentine heart,
The trimming on
A circus cart.
Red is a lipstick,
Red is a shout,
Red is a signal
That says: "Watch out!"
Red is a great big
Rubber ball.
Red is the giantest
Color of all.
Red is a show off
No doubt about it
But can you imagine
Living without it?

What is White? 

White is a Dove 
And lily of the valley 
And a puddle of milk 
Spilled in an alley 
A ship's sail 
A kite's tail 
A wedding veil 
Hailstones and 
Halibut bones 
And some people's 
Telephones. 
The hottest and most blinding light 
Is white. 
And breath is white 
When you blow it out on a frosty night. 
White is the shining absence of all color 
Then absence is white 
Out of touch 
Out of sight. 

White is marshmallow 
And vanilla ice cream 
And the part you can't remember 
In a dream. 
White is the sound 
Of a light foot walking 
White is a pair of 
Whispers talking. 
White is the beautiful 
Broken lace 
Of snowflakes falling 
On your face. 
You can smell white 
In a country room 
Toward the end of May 
In the cherry bloom. 


What Is Black?

Black is the night
When there isn't a star
And you can't tell by looking
Where you are.
Black is a pail of paving tar. 
Black is jet
And things you'd like to forget
Black is a smokestack
Black is a cat,
A leopard, a raven,
A high silk hat.
The sound of black is 
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"
Echoing in
An empty room.
Black is kind
It covers up
The rundown street, 
The broken cup.
Black is charcoal
And patio grill,
The soot spots on 
The window sill.
Black is a feeling
Hard to explain
Like suffering but
Without the pain.
Black is licorice
And patent leather shoes
Black is the print 
In the news.
Black is beauty
In its deepest form,
The darkest cloud 
In a thunderstorm.
Think of what starlight
And lamplight would lack
Diamonds and fireflies
If they couldn't lean against Black...
