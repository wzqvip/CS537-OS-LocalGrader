Running Tests
-------------

From your working directory, run 
    ~cs537-1/tests/runtests

If you want to run all the tests despite any failures, use
    ~cs537-1/tests/runtests -c

List of other Testing Scripts:
    ~cs537-1/tests/runtests starter
    ~cs537-1/tests/runtests wmap
    ~cs537-1/tests/runtests wunmap
    ~cs537-1/tests/runtests fork
    ~cs537-1/tests/runtests wremap

The pregrade script will also work, so once you are ready to handin, once you have copied your files to your handin directory,
you can run it to ensure that your submission has the correct folder/file structure.
