Just clone things from the linux machine that can run on your machine. (But why I need this?)

# P1

Use some unix-style machine like WSL on Windows.

```
./test-madcounter.csh
```

If you want to see all the test points, use `-c`

```
./test-madcounter.csh -c
```

To see complete output (and log to file).

```
./test-madcounter.csh -c -vv > log.txt
```
